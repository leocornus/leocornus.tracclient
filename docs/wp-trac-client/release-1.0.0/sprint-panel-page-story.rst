Sprint Panel for a Project
==========================

Sprint panel page for a project will be 2 columns page.
::

  <div id="sprint-panel" class="container-fluid">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6" id="sprint-list">
        <!-- list of sprints, sort by date desc -->
        <div class="panel panel-warning" id="sprint-[SPRINT NAME]">
          <div class="panel-headding">
            <span class="panel-title">Sprint Name</span>
            <span class="pull-right">tickets summary</span>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6" id="open-tickets-list">
        <!-- list of open tickets, sort by priority -->
        <div class="panel panel-primary" id="sprint-backlog">
          <div class="panel-headding">
            <span class="panel-title">Backlog</span>
            <span class="pull-right">tickets summary</span>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

Right column will have a list of sprint, sorting by date desc.
Left column will be a list of tickets / stories,
which don't assign to any sprint.
Tickets will be sorted by priority.

  :depth: 5

Simple Rules
------------

We should call it conventions instead of rules.

- sprint will be saved in version custom field.
- sprint list will sort by sprint date, desc
- tickets without sprint (sprint field is empty) 
  will be considered as backlog tickets.

Homepage Content
----------------

The sprint panel homepage will show backlog and the most recent
2 sprints.
One sprint will have the follwing contents::

  <div class="panel panel-danger">
    <!-- panel heading for sprint name and summary -->
    <div class="panel-heading">
      <span class="panel-title">Sprint Name</span>
      <span class="pull-right">tickets summary</span>
    </div>
    
    <!-- panel body for a sprint.-->
    <div class="panel-body">
      some brief description for this sprint,
      how about time range for this sprint?
    </div>

    <!-- we could use list group directly in panel. -->
    <!-- list group with linked items for ticket list. -->
    <div class="list-group"
         style="min-height:300; max-height:350; overflow-y:auto;
                overflow-x:hidden;"
    >
      <a href="#" class="list-group-item clearfix">
      <!-- we need clearfix for multiple lines, the br element -->
        <span class="badge">ticket id</span>
        ticket summary more summary more and more
        Cras justo this will be long summary 
        <br/>
        <!-- status, priority for aticket. -->
        <div class="pull-right">
          <!-- we will using danger for blocker and critical -->
          <!-- we will using warning for major -->
          <!-- we will using default for minor and trival -->
          <span class="label label-danger">blocker</span>
          <span class="label label-primary">assigned</span> to 
          <span class="label label-info">Sean Chen</span>
        </div>
      </a>
    </div>

    <!-- panel body for a sprint.-->
    <div class="panel-footer">
      panel footer didn't inherit background color from
      panel heading. It is also hard to change the bg color.
    </div>
  </div>

**Highlights**

- using badge for ticket id, TODO: will use points in the future.
- using label for ticket status, priority, and owner.
- TODO: will use icon for each ticket, 
- panel-body might used as panel footer. 
  panel-footer is hard to change bg color and it does NOT inherit
  background color from heading.
- the min-height and max-height will be used to control the height
  of a listgroup. We will not have this for first release.

Example of height and scroll bar for list-group::

  style="min-height:300; max-height:350; overflow-y:auto;
         overflow-x:hidden;"

Query for backlog
-----------------

the criterial for backlog will be either version is empty or
version ends with backlog.

here is one of the proposal::

  // handle the version query.
  if(!empty($version)) {
      if($version == 'BACKLOG') {
          $v_none = array_merge($query, array('version='));
          $v_backlog = array_merge($query, 
                                   array('version=~backlog'));
          $v_none = implode("&", $v_none);
          $v_backlog = implode("&", $v_backlog);
          //$query[] = "version=";
          $the_query = "{$v_none}&or&{$v_backlog}";
          //$the_query = implode("&", $query);
      } else {
          $query[] = "version={$version}";
          $the_query = implode("&", $query);
      }

      return $the_query;
  }

Process flow
------------

simple idea about process flow:

- PHP class to load current sprint, the most recent sprint.
- 
- backlog will have special tweak: combine tickets for
  versions ends with backlog and tickets with no version at all.

JavaScript Client
-----------------

design of the js client for 

wp AJAX call back
-----------------

What we need:

- callback function to return available sprints.
- query tickets by sprint (the version custom field)!
